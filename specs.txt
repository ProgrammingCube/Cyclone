This will be a 3D rhythm game with mechanics similar to Geometry Dash

However, these will be the core gameplay mechanics:

1. Player will have a trail behind him to show movement
2. Player will be center of motion UNLESS OTHERWISE SCRIPTED
3. Platforms will be used to maneuver, spikes will be obstacles, jump pads will be used for large
   jumps
4. Gravity can shift UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Later, perhaps gravity can shift FORWARD and
   BACKWARD to pair with rotations
5. Player cube can rotate freely
6. Entire scene can rotate freely or relatively to current global rotation
7. Scenery can rotate around player irregardless of gravity vector
8. Paired with previous, shifts will be triggered by crossing Z planes
9. Win state is reaching end of level
10. When player "dies", a cube breaking animation is played
11. Music can be added in to level
12. Simple sound effects and/or controller vibration will be added for jump, landing, death,
    jumppads
